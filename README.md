# Personal Blog

This repository contains my personal blog powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages.
Stories are written in Markdown inside the `_posts` directory. The site uses the `minima` theme with additional custom styles.

## Local development

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
