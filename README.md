# Personal Blog

This is my personal website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). All stories live in the `_posts` directory and are written in Markdown. The site uses the `minima` theme with a few custom styles.

## Running locally

Install Jekyll and Bundler:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Then install dependencies and start the local server:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`.
